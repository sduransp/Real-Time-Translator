        Performs real-time speech recognition using the Whisper model.

        Parameters:
        - model (str): Whisper model to use (tiny, base, small, medium, large). Default is "medium".
        - non_english (bool): If set, does not use the English model. Default is False.
        - energy_threshold (int): Energy level for the microphone to detect. Default is 1000.
        - record_timeout (float): How real-time the recording is in seconds. Default is 2.
        - phrase_timeout (float): How much empty space between recordings before considering it a new line in the transcription. Default is 3.
